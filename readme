Word Game I wrote in C in late 2023.
You are given a certain amount of random letters. You then type in words using those letters and depending 
on the letters in the words each word is worth a certain amount of points (uses same point system as scrabble)
You have a certain amount of tries to guess as many words as possible. After you guess wrong enough you will loose

The goal is to score as many points as possible!
